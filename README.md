Details about Projects:

All the Applications were written using Python, unless mentioned.
For any detailed information on any Assignment, please refer to the Assignment document in each individual Assignment folder.

Project 1

The assignment provides a utility that runs on your local device that allows

files in your local file system to be dropped into Google cloud storage, for added

safety those files should be encrypted, and after moving the encrypted file to Google

cloud it should be deleted from the local device and also we will be able to 

retrieve a file and decrypt it.

I used a (validated) single key encryption, such as AES, and each file 

have itâ€™s own key (password) so the program prompts for that key/password.

The program is also able to list and remove files from your 

cloud storage. The encryption and Decryption is done both locally and on cloud.


Project 2

assignment_2_upload.py : This file copies the file from a link provided to the cloud

main.py : Contains code necessary to determine the number of earthquakes for each week, for magnitudes    

2, 3, 4, and 5 (or greater) from data that we uploaded in assignment_2_upload.py

Project 3 

Using Google App Engine and assignment 2, we put a Web interface allowing

users (of that web interface) to create queries for magnitude or location on this data set.

Project 4

To use A large number of queries with and without Memcache

Project 5

Using AWS repeated creating and queries of data using: DynamoDB (A NoSQL DB) and created

a Web interface allowing users (of that web interface) to dynamically create queries.
(This was done on local system)

Project 6

To show results obtained from the data set over 25 years to deduce whether the region is getting warmer or dryer over the time span

over a dataset

(This program was done using JAVA)

Project 7

We successfully deployed an application which allows the user to upload an image and then add comments to it. The user is also able to register as well as sign in.

Project 8 

We used Python libraries like Scipy, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc to achieve our goal of creating different clusters as well as plotting them on the graph.

The dataset we used was numerical.

Project 9 

We used Flask Framework in python along with ec2 to host our application in order to achieve our goal of visualizing data.

(1) Cluster Using python Libraries
(2) Bar chart Using d3.js
(3) Scatter chart Using d3.js

Project 10

Created an application(Web interface) that

(1) Creates a 3 Dimensional cluster on Numerical data using Python libraries
(2) Creates a word cloud using the words user provides.


Note: For any datasets please refer to the individual documents or the programming file to get the link to the dataset.
Some Assignments were done in team of 3.
Name of the team members are clearly mentioned in the documents.
